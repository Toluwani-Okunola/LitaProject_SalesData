### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a retail store over the past and current year. By analysising various aspect of the data, we seek to identify (top selling product, product performance, regional performance and monthly sales trend, make data driven reccommendation and gain deeper understanding of the store performance

### Metrics of Focus

1. Total Sales
2. Product Performance
3. Regional performance
4. Sales trends


### Tool Used

- Excel: 
  - Data Cleaning and Preparation
  - Data Analysis
- SQL: Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Power BI:
  - Data Visualization
  - Creating Report


### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial stage, I performed the following task:
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Cleaning and Formating


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;
  1. What is the overall sales trends?
  2. Which products are top sellers?
  3. What is the regional performance?
